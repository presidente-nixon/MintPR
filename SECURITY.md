## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you are to report a vultnerability, you should create a bug report at https://github.com/presidente-nixon/Multiprocessing-for-FFmpeg-Interpolation/issues explaining what has gone wrong and use the bug template.

If the vulnerability is accepted then you should see a patch hopefully within a day, however, the time it takes depends a lot on the bug itself.
